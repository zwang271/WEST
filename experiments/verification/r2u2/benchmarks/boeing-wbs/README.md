# Boeing Wheel Brake System Benchmarks

Benchmarks adapted from [Satisfiability Checking for Mission-Time LTL](https://research.temporallogic.org/papers/LVR19.pdf). The artifact can be downloaded from [artifact.tar.xz](https://temporallogic.org/research/CAV19/artifact.tar.xz).

The original SMV (and OCRA, not used here) models were developed from [Formal Design and Safety Analysis of AIR6110 Wheel Brake System](https://es-static.fbk.eu/projects/air6110/download/CAV2015_paper.pdf). The artifact can be found at FBK's webpage for [the project](https://es-static.fbk.eu/projects/air6110/index.php?n=Main.Download).

Traces are only headers so that the MLTL files can be compiled.
