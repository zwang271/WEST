# CySat-I Benchmarks

Benchmarks adapted from [Runtime Verification Triggers Real-time, Autonomous Fault Recovery on the CySat-I](http://research.temporallogic.org/papers/AJR22.pdf). The specifications are listed in this [document](https://temporallogic.org/research/CySat-NFM22/Specifications_And_Signals.pdf).

The [trace file included](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaurandt/CySat-I_R2U2/main/Raw_Data/NumUnderVoltageFault.csv) can be used for compiling a specification and runtime monitoring. See the [raw data](https://github.com/aaurandt/CySat-I_R2U2/tree/main/Raw_Data) found in the paper for the full real-world traces.
