* Todo: Lab manual 1&2, Intro tickets

Goal:
  - Zach and Jessica work
  - Identify focus area for undergrads

===============================================================================

- Catching up synchronous engine to asynchronous engine
- Adding back in BNs
- Finishing Pei's resource estimation front-end GUI to allow NASA engineers to design a R2U2 setup with estimation of the resources that would takt
- Work on specification elicitation tools including (but not limited to) expanding and finishing the work started by Chris Pohlen on timeline visualizations for LTL/MLTL formulas so that it's easier for engineers to write and debug them and see what they mean.
