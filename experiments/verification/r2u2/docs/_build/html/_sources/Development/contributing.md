# Contributing

## Workflow

In general, the "git-flow" branching model is used for contributions.

1. Work on a branch
2. Open a merge request when ready
3. Wait until at least one reviewer approves before merging

All merge requests should contain tests and documentation when applicable.

As general guidelines, it is recommended that all projects adopt an auto-formatter and stick to it to reduce bikesheding and formatting-driven code churn.
