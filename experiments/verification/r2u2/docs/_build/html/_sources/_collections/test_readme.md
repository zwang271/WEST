# R2U2 Test Suite

The R2U2 test suite is intended to test a given `r2u2prep.py` script and `r2u2` binary. Each test case in a suite has an MLTL specification, a trace, and an oracle. The test script compiles the MLTL specification using the given `r2u2prep.py` script, runs the given `r2u2` binary over the compiled specification and trace, and compares the output to the oracle.

## Usage

To run the test suite, run the `r2u2test.py` script as follows:
```bash
python r2u2test.py path/to/r2u2prep.py path/to/r2u2bin SUITE1 SUITE2 ...
```
where `path/to/r2u2prep.py` is the relative or absolute path to the r2u2prep.py script to use for compiling specifications, `path/to/r2u2bin` is the relative or absolute path to the r2u2 binary to run, and `SUITE1 SUITE2 ...` is a non-empty list of suite names to run.

An example command to run the regression test suite from the top-level `r2u2/` directory is as follows:
```bash
python test/r2u2test.py compiler/r2u2prep.py monitors/static/build/r2u2 regression
```
assuming that the C version of the `r2u2` binary has been built. The test results can be seen in the `test/results` directory by default.

Use the `--copyback` option to copy all the files used in the test case to the results directory. This is useful for re-running and debugging specific test cases.

## Suites

The JSON files in the `test/suites` directory correspond to the available suites. Some available suites are:
- `ft_subset`
- `pt_subset`
- `regression`
- `cav`
- `all` (runs every suite in `test/suites`)

## Adding New Suites

To add a new suite, it is easiest to build off of an existing JSON configuration file. The structure of the JSON files is as follows:

```json
{
    "suite": "SUITE_NAME",
    "options": {
        "compiler-option": "COMPILER_OPTION_VALUE"
    },
    "tests": [
        {
            "name": "TEST_NAME",
            "mltl": "MLTL_FILENAME",
            "trace": "TRACE_FILENAME",
            "oracle": "ORACLE_FILENAME",
            "options": {
                "compiler-option": "COMPILER_OPTION_VALUE"
            }
        }
    ],
    "suites": [ "SUITE_1", "SUITE_2", ... ]
}
```
where `"SUITE_NAME"` should be the same as the name of the JSON file (minus the .json extension), `"options"` is an object corresponding to the CLI options given to the compiler (these options can be overridden for individual tests), `"tests"` is an array of objects that describe test cases. 

The test cases require a `"name"`, an `"mltl"` filename that exists in in `test/mltl`, a `"trace"` filename that exists in `test/trace`, and an `"oracle"` filename that exists in `test/oracle`.

Each `"SUITE_N"` in the `"suites"` attribute should be the name of a suite in the `suites/` directory, where each named suite will be run.
