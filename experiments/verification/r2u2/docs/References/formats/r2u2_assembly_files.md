# R2U2 Assembly [`.asm`]

R2U2 assembly files provide a UTF-8 encoded, human-readable listing of R2U2 monitor instructions.

As they are not currently machine read the format is not fully specified and is mainly used to cross-reference with monitor debug output to ensure the serialization and deserialization of the [specification binary](./r2u2_configuration_binary_files.md) was successful by cross-referencing the assembly listing with the debug logging output of the monitor.
