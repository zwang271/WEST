publisher="Springer Nature Switzerland",
address="Cham",
pages="483--497",
abstract="R2U2 is a modular runtime verification framework capable of monitoring sets of specifications in real time and in resource-constrained environments. Such environments demand that a runtime monitor be fast, easily integratable, accessible to domain experts, and have predictable resource requirements. Version 3.0 adds new features to R2U2 and its associated suite of tools that meet these needs including a new front-end compiler that accepts a custom specification language, a GUI for resource estimation, and improvements to R2U2's internal architecture.",

abstract="We present an algorithmic framework that allows on-line monitoring of past-time MTL specifications in a discrete time setting. The algorithms allow to be synthesized into efficient observer hardware blocks, which take advantage of the highly-parallel nature of hardware designs. For the time-bounded Since operator of past-time MTL we obtain a time complexity that is double logarithmic in the time it is executed at and the given time bounds of the Since operator. This result is promising with respect to a non-interfering monitoring approach that evaluates real-time specifications during the execution of the system-under-test. The resulting hardware blocks are reconfigurable and have applications in prototyping and runtime verification of embedded real-time systems.",
