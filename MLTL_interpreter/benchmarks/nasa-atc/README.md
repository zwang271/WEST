# NASA ATC Benchmarks

Benchmarks adapted from [Satisfiability Checking for Mission-Time LTL](https://research.temporallogic.org/papers/LVR19.pdf). The artifact can be downloaded from [artifact.tar.xz](https://temporallogic.org/research/CAV19/artifact.tar.xz).

The original SMV (and OCRA, not used here) models were developed from [Model Checking at Scale: Automated Air Traffic Control Design Space Exploration](https://research.temporallogic.org/papers/GCMTR16_CAV.pdf). The artifact can be found at FBK's webpage for [the project](https://es-static.fbk.eu/projects/nasa-aac/).

Traces are only headers so that the MLTL files can be compiled.
