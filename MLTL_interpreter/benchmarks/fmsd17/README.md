# FMSD 2017 Paper Benchmarks

Benchmarks from [R2U2: Monitoring and Diagnosis of Security Threats for Unmanned Aerial Systems](https://research.temporallogic.org/papers/MRS17_FMSD.pdf). All MLTL files are derived from case studies given in paper.

The GPS Spoofing case study does not involved any temporal operators, so it is omitted.
