        <p>The WEST program strips whitespaces from input.<br>
        Non-empty intervals are recommended for meaningful truth table generation. </p>

        <p><b>Propositional Variables and Constants</b></p>
        <p>True: <tt>true</tt><br>
        False: <tt>false</tt><br>
        First Variable: <tt>p0</tt><br>
        Second Variable: <tt>p1</tt></p>
        <p>And so on, where each consecutive variable is followed with the appropriate natural number.</p>

        <p>Let K be a well-formed formula, propositional variable, or propositional constant. <br>
        Formulas do not necessarily need to be in negation normal form, as the WEST program converts formulas into this form <br>
        and generates the truth table for the formula's translated syntax. <br>
        The user does not necessarily need to start their propositional variables at p0. <br>
        That is, a user can input a formula that, for example, includes only the propositional variables p3, p4, and p7. <br>
        For faster runtime and less memory usage, however, it is not recommended to skip natural numbers like this.</p>

        <p><b>Unary Propositional Connectives</b><br>
        The only unary propositional connective is negation.<br>
        Negation does NOT use parentheses.<br>
        Let K be a well-formed formula, propositional variable, or propositional constant.</p>
        <p>Negation: <tt>~K</tt> </p>

        <p><b>Unary Temporal Connectives</b><br>
        All temporal operators must be followed by an interval.<br>
        All intervals must be followed by a well-formed formula, propositional variable, or propositional constant. <br>
        Unary temporal operators do NOT use parentheses.<br>
        Let a be the inclusive lower bound of an interval, and let b be inclusive upper bound of an interval. <br>
        Let "," separate a and b, and "[" and "]" indicate the beginning and end of an interval, respectively.<br>
        Let K be a well-formed formula, propositional variable, or propositional constant.</p>
        <p>Finally: <tt>F[a,b] K</tt><br>
        Globally: <tt>G[a,b] K</tt></p>


        <p><b>Binary Propositional Connectives</b><br>
        All binary connectives must be enclosed with parentheses.<br>
        Let K, L be well-formed formulas, propositional variables, or propositional constants.</p>
        <p>And: <tt>(K & L)</tt><br>
        Or: <tt>(K | L)</tt><br>
        Equivalence: <tt>(K = L)</tt><br>
        Implies: <tt>(K -> L)</tt></p>


        <p><b>Binary Temporal Connectives</b><br>
        All binary connectives must be enclosed with parentheses.<br>
        All temporal operators must be followed by an interval. <br>
        All intervals must be followed by a well-formed formula, propositional variable, or propositional constant.<br>
        Let a be the inclusive lower bound of an interval, and let b be inclusive upper bound of an interval. <br>
        Let "," separate a and b, and "[" and "]" indicate the beginning and end of an interval, respectively.<br>
        Let K, L be well-formed formulas, propositional variables, or propositional constants.</p>
        <p>Until: <tt>(K U[a,b] L)</tt><br>
        Release: <tt>(K R[a,b] L)</tt></p>


        <p><b>Associative Propositional Connectives</b><br>
        The entirety of the associative propositional connective formula string must be enclosed in parentheses.<br>
        The list of elements must be preceded by the associative propositional connective.<br>
        Let "," separate each element in the list, and let "[" and "]" indicate the beginning and end of the list, respectively.<br>
        Let K, L, ..., M be an arbitrarily-sized list of well-formed formulas, propositional variables, or propositional constants.</p>
        <p>And: <tt>(&[K, L, ..., M])</tt><br>
        Or: <tt>(|[K, L, ..., M])</tt><br>
        Equivalence: <tt>(=[K, L, ..., M])</tt><br>
        Implies: <tt>(->[K, L, ..., M])</tt></p>

        <p><b>A note on the associative equivalence operator:</b> for lists with 2 elements, the equivalence operator functions <br>
        identically to the binary propositional connective equivalence operator. <br>
        For formulas with 3 or more elements, the associative equivalence operator does not mean "each element in the list is equivalent".<br> 
        Instead, it means that the equivalence of the first two elements in the list is equivalent to the next element in the list, <br>
        and the truth value for this expression is equivalent to the next element, and so on. <br>
        For example:</p>
        <p><tt>(=[p0,p1,p2])</tt> is equivalent to <tt>((p0=p1)=p2)</tt><br>
        <tt>(=[p0,p1,p2,p3...])</tt> is equivalent to <tt>(...(((p0=p1)=p2)=p3)...)</tt></p>
        <p>But,</p>
        <p><tt>(=[p0,p1,p2])</tt> is not equivalent to <tt>(p0=p1=p2)</tt></p>
        <p>Note that <tt>(p0=p1=p2)</tt> is not a valid input. Therefore, if one wishes to generate the truth table for a formula<br>
        that means "each element in the list is equivalent", then one could employ the transitivity of the equivalence operator<br>
        with the <tt>and</tt> operator. <br>
        For example:</p>
        <p><tt>(p0=p1=p2=p3)</tt> can be inputted as <tt>(&[(p0=p1), (p1=p2), (p2=p3])</tt></p>
