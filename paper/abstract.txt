The WEST mLTL Truth Table Generator is a program that parses well-formed mLTL formulas and outputs
the regular expression for the computations that satisfy the formula.
Our recursive algorithm is based on the regular expressions of mLTL operators and runs with approximately doubly exponential space and time complexity.

In our paper, "Describing Mission-time LTL Formulas with Regular
Expressions using the WEST Program", we: Formally prove the algorithm's correctness; Formally derive its space/time complextiy (doubly-exponential); 
Experimentally analyze its space/time complexity; Experimentally validate WEST's correctness through State-flow Digraphs and Test Suites.
