# WEST mLTL Truth Table Generator

The WEST mLTL Truth Table Generator is a program that parses well-formed mLTL formulas and outputs the structure of the computations of these formulas and their substrings. Our recursive algorithm is based on the regular expressions of mLTL operators and runs with approximately doubly exponential space and time complexity.

## Usage

After downloading and cloning this repository, use the commands
``` 
$ cd 2022-Iowa-State-REU-Temporal-Logic-
$ cd MLTL_reg
$ cd MLTL
$ make west
$ ./west
```
Then, the user will be prompted:
```
Please enter a MLTL formula.
```
See the Grammar section below to inform input.


## Grammar
The WEST program strips whitespaces from input.
Non-empty intervals are recommended for meaningful truth table generation.

### **Propositional Variables and Constants**
**True:** T <br />
**False:** ! <br />
**First Variable:** p0 <br />
**Second Variable:** p1 <br />
And so on, where each consecutive variable is followed with the appropriate natural number. <br />

Let K be a well-formed formula, propositional variable, or propositional constant. <br />
Formulas do not necessarily need to be in negation normal form, as the WEST program converts formulas into this form and generates the truth table for the formula's translated syntax. <br />
The user does not necessarily need to start their propositional variables at p0. That is, a user can input a formula that, for example, includes only the propositional variables p3, p4, and p7. For faster runtime and less memory usage, however, it is not recommended to skip natural numbers like this. <br />

After inputting a well-formed mLTL formula, the user will be prompted:
```
Please enter number of propositional variables.
```
Where the user will enter an appropriate integer. This number must be at least one more than the largest number attached to a propositional variable. For example, for a formula with the propositional variables p3, p4, and p7, the user must enter at least 8. If the user enters too small of a number, the program will crash. <br />

If exclusively propositional constants are inputted, then the user should enter "1" for the number of propositional variables in order to generate a meaningful truth table. 

### **Unary Propositional Connectives**
The only unary propositional connective is negation. <br />
Negation does NOT use parentheses. <br />
Let K be a well-formed formula, propositional variable, or propositional constant. <br />
**Negation:** ~ K <br />

### **Unary Temporal Connectives**
All temporal operators must be followed by an interval. All intervals must be followed by a well-formed formula, propositional variable, or propositional constant. <br />
Unary temporal operators do NOT use parentheses. <br />
Let a be the inclusive lower bound of an interval, and let b be inclusive upper bound of an interval. Let ":" separate a and b, and "[" and "]" indicate the beginning and end of an interval, respectively.  <br />
Let K be a well-formed formula, propositional variable, or propositional constant. <br />

**Finally:** F[a:b] K <br />
**Globally:** G[a:b] K <br />


### **Binary Propositional Connectives**
All binary connectives must be enclosed with parentheses. <br />
Let K, L be well-formed formulas, propositional variables, or propositional constants. <br />

**And:** (K & L) <br />
**Or:** (K v L)  <br />
**Equivalence:** (K = L)  <br />
**Implies:** (K > L)  <br />


### **Binary Temporal Connectives**
All binary connectives must be enclosed with parentheses. <br />
All temporal operators must be followed by an interval. All intervals must be followed by a well-formed formula, propositional variable, or propositional constant. <br />
Let a be the inclusive lower bound of an interval, and let b be inclusive upper bound of an interval. Let ":" separate a and b, and "[" and "]" indicate the beginning and end of an interval, respectively.
Let K, L be well-formed formulas, propositional variables, or propositional constants. <br />

**Until:** (K U[a:b] L) <br />
**Release** (K R[a:b] L) <br />





### **Associative Propositional Connectives**
The entirety of the associative propositional connective formula string must be enclosed in parentheses.  <br />
The list of elements must be preceded by the associative propositional connective. <br />
Let "," separate each element in the list, and let "[" and "]" indicate the beginning and end of the list, respectively. <br />
Let K, L, ..., M be an arbitrarily-sized list of well-formed formulas, propositional variables, or propositional constants. <br />

**And:** (&[K, L, ..., M]) <br />
**Or:** (v[K, L, ..., M])  <br />
**Equivalence:** (=[K, L, ..., M])  <br />
**Implies:** (>[K, L, ..., M])  <br />

**A note on the associative equivalence operator:** for lists with 2 elements, the equivalence operator functions identically to the binary propositional connective equivalence operator. For formulas with 3 or more elements, the associative equivalence operator does not mean "each element in the list is equivalent". Instead, it means that the equivalence of the first two elements in the list is equivalent to the next element in the list, and the truth value for this expression is equivalent to the next element, and so on. For example:
```
(=[p0,p1,p2]) is equivalent to ((p0=p1)=p2)
(=[p0,p1,p2,p3...]) is equivalent to (...(((p0=p1)=p2)=p3)...
But,
(=[p0,p1,p2]) is not equivalent to (p0=p1=p2)
```


Note that (p0=p1=p2) is not a valid input; therefore, if one wishes to generate the truth table for a formula that means "each element in the list is equivalent", then one could employ the transitivity of the equivalence operator with the and operator. For example,
```
(p0=p1=p2=p3) can be inputted as (&[(p0=p1), (p1=p2), (p2=p3])
```

## Computations
In a computation, "1" represents a true truth value, and "0" represents a false truth value; "S" represents an arbitrary truth value, i.e. true or false.
Time steps in a computation are separated by commas. The bit-strings at each time step represent the truth values of each propositional variable, in ascending order. <br />

**Examples:** <br />
The computation of a formula with one propositional variable and 5 time steps is represented as:
```
NNF Formula: G[0:4]p0

1,1,1,1,1
```
The computation of a formula with 5 propositional variables and one time step is represented as:
```
NNF Formula: G[0:0](&[p0,p1,p2,p3,p4])

11111
````
The computations of a formula with two propositional variables that are both eventually true at a third time step are represented as:
```
NNF Formula: F[0:2](p0&p1)

11,ss,ss
ss,11,ss
ss,ss,11
```
Where in each string separated by commas, the first digit represents the truth value of p0, and the second digit represents the truth value of p1.


## Example
An interesting mLTL formula to consider is that of the oscillation of the truth value of a propositional variable for each time step.
Here is how a user may generate the truth table for this formula:
```
Please enter a MLTL formula.
$ G[0:2] (&[(p0 > G[1:1]~p0), (~p0 > G[1:1]p0)])
Please enter number of propositional variables.
$ 1
Would you like to generate the truth table? (y / n)
$ y
NNF Formula: G[0:2](&[(p0>G[1:1]~p0),(~p0>G[1:1]p0)])

Subformula: p0
1

Subformula: ~p0
0

Subformula: G[1:1]~p0
s,0

Subformula: (p0>G[1:1]~p0)
0,s
s,0

Subformula: G[1:1]p0
s,1

Subformula: (~p0>G[1:1]p0)
1,s
s,1

Subformula: (&[(p0>G[1:1]~p0),(~p0>G[1:1]p0)])
0,1
1,0

G[0:2](&[(p0>G[1:1]~p0),(~p0>G[1:1]p0)])
0,1,0,1
1,0,1,0

##Subformulas and Simplification Options
As seen in the example output above, the user may choose to display the satisfying computations of all the subformulas. By default, the WEST program will show subformulas.<br />

The WEST program also allows the user to choose whether or not to simplify the satisfying computations. In almost all cases, this will dramatically reduce the number of outputted regular expressions, improving readability. However, this setting does increase runtime. By default, the WEST program simplifies outputs.


## Troubleshooting Guide

### The Program Crashed
Ensure that the number of propositional variables was large enough. The number must be at least one larger than the largest natural number attached to a propositional variable, not just the number of propositional variables in the formula. For example, the formula
```
(p1U[0:2]p3)
```
requires at least 4 propositional variables, not 2.

### The Formula is not Well-Formed
Ensure that all time intervals use ':' to separate the bounds and not a comma.  <br />
Ensure that all binary and associative connectives have parentheses surrounding them.  <br />
Ensure that for each propositional variable, its corresponding natural number immediately follows the 'p', and that there isn't a '_' or space in between.  <br />
Ensure that all unary connectives do NOT have parentheses surrounding them.
