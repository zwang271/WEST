# Welcome to the WEST tool

The WEST tool provides an automated way to generate *regular expressions*[^1] describing the set of **all satisfying computations to Mission-time Linear Temporal Logic formulas**, i.e., that describe the valuations of a given mLTL formula (of a fixed lenght) that satisfy it.

[^1]: We use this term in a rather liberal way, since we only deal with regular languages containining strings of a fixed lenght and we use the character `s` as a shorthand for `0 or 1`, although it is technically not an element of the alphabet.
