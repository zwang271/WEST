- Text or figure example to show how WEST would be used to validate a specification
- Implementing REST thm and run experiments to determine usefullness 
- Edit text to emphasis the fact that we're doing validation rather than solving SAT
- Cite works of SAT solvers, specify our work is necessary to even begin using these solvers in a meaningful way
- creating a nice GUI
- "a better discussion of/comparison with other visualization methods, most commonly automata. 
We should point out firstly that there is currently no tool that visualizes MLTL
in the form of automata, but that can be future work. 
Also, there is no tool that visualizes MLTL in *any* form. 
Even if there were an MLTL-> automata tool (which realistically could be published any second because
it's a common idea), that would not fill the same niche for formulavalidation; we can give examples here."


Constructive Reviews
- The description of the algorithms leaves some points unclear
- The technique to simplify regular expressions (section 6) has not been implemented, and its effectiveness is unclear
- Actually, the validation could be improved by using coverage criteria that are less prone to the path-explosion problem, 
such as branch, statement, or decision coverage.




Misinterpreted Reviews
- "However, it's not clear to me how translating MLTL formulas to regular expressions would enable their validation.
One reason I can think of is that regular expressions might be more familiar to some users not expert in formal methods, 
but the regular expressions generated by the tool in the experimental evaluation are more than exponentially larger than 
the input formulas."
